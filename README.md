## Description of the project

This is a pet project that I made to practice with html, css and JavaScript. I used SCSS preprocessor to compile styles to style.css, used SCSS modules to split SCSS code into sections, experimented with sass variables (espesially with associative arrays). I made
the cards slider with JavaScript. The website was built with flexbox, grid.

This project is better viewed with VS Code (plagins: Live Server, Live Sass Compiler).
